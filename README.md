### Hi there, I'm Arttu Ylhävuori, a program designer at Talgraf Oy 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on _Full stack open 2020_ [course](https://fullstackopen.com/en) made by University of Helsinki
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to test Express servers and create a user administration ([part #4](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4) in full stack open 2020)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on various open-source projects that feel interesting to me
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with .NET related subjects
- 💬 Ask me about especially front-end, Android or macOS related questions
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arttuylh), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arttuylh/) or [email](mailto:arttu.ylhavuori(a)hotmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: One of my superpowers is phenomenal attentiveness. I am very sensitive to the slightest typos in both text and program code. In the case of plain text, though these errors are often left unsaid, no mercy is given in the code.
